      # Project Name: Variable and threshold
      # Project Purpose: To determine if two variables are greater than the other
      # Project Function: Is the variable greater than the other
      # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Psuedocode:
      # var is created and equal to 25.
      # threshold is created and equal to 48.
      # if var is greater than threshold then the program will print higher. Otherwise, it will print lower.
      # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

var = 25
threshold = 48

if var > threshold:
      print("higher")
else:
      print("lower")
